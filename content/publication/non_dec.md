abstract = "We present a class of algorithms capable of directly training deep neural networks with respect to task-specific performance measures such as the F-measure and the Kullback-Leibler diver- gence that are structured and non-decomposable. This presents a departure from standard deep learning techniques that typically use squared or cross-entropy loss functions, that are decompos- able, to train the networks."
