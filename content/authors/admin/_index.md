# Biography

I am Amartya Sanyal, currently a D.Phil(PhD) student at the Department of Computer Science at the *University of Oxford* where I am advised by Prof. Varun Kanade and Prof. Phil H.S. Torr. I completed by Bachelor Of Technology in Computer Science And Engineering from the *Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur* in 2017.

Currently, my research interests span theoretical and empirical investigation on the reliability of modern deep learning methods in aspects of robustness and generalization in the presence of noise.  In particular, I look at the importance of proper regularizations and representation learning that can  help to effectively improve these properties. My research also looks at improving privacy, calibration and computational efficiency of deep learning methods.
