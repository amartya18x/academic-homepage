# Biography

I am Amartya Sanyal, currently a D.Phil(PhD) student at the Department of Computer Science at the *University of Oxford* working with Prof. Varun Kanade and Prof. Phil H.S. Torr. I completed by Bachelor Of Technology in Computer Science And Engineering from the *Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur* in 2017.

I am interested in understanding why _Deep Neural Networks_, in whatever form, perform as good as they do. My research revolves around understanding mathematical properties regarding the structures of these networks and designing and analysing optimization algorithms that can exploit their properties. In the process, I also hope to come up with some practical applications using these findings. I am also interested in Optimization and Learning Theory in general.
