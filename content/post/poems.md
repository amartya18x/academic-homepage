# Potato

>He had always been there.  
>In the dark and wet soil waited he,  
>For going out to the lighter place.  
>He did hear about it from his crawling friend.  
>But he couldn't move and so he waited  
>Once in a while drenched when it rained  
>And sometimes dried to a pulp  
>But he survived though all this,  
>For his mother piped down whatever he needed.

>One fine day, there was a tug  
>And a pull and a crack in the sky.  
>And he was pulled out in the open.  
>His roots were severed and washed  
>And he was tossed onto a truck,  
>Ready for a journey of the world.  

> He had never been happier.  

>Soon though, his life took many turns.  
>When entered he a kitchen-  
>his skin filled with holes  and burns.  
>Tossed into hot boiling water,  
>much hotter than those famines,  
>Cut into pieces and smashed,  
>he was stuffed into a dead chicken  
>And all he longed was to get back his damp dark soil.  

# Dustbin

>I was so happy, blessed by my generosity  
>For I am an home to the wretched,  
>a bed for those miserably and painfully  
>__thrown__ into the material oblivion.  
>And I was so proud too  
>For he cleaned me everyday  
>And to mourn the __passing away__ of those wretched,  
>He would cover me in the lightest black fabric.  
>I would never understand though
>why they so much would hate me.  
>I would learn later they called me their nemesis.

>But often I wondered, what would happen of me  
>If I ever grew wretched.  
>Would someone mourn for me too?  
>And would they pass me off too with other old people?  
>Karma would take care of me. I knew karma would.
>After all I did abound in karmic goods.
>And hence worried I not.

>One fine morning, picked I was.  
>They broke my sides.  
>Crushed my mouth  
>They told me, I had to be recycled.  
>Off I went, after all the good works  
>Into the mouth of the hell, into the fiery gates  
>And sooner than not bit by bit, my body gave away.  
>A bit into a pen factory  
>A bit into those thin black fabric  
>And the rest to make some more __Nemesis__


# The Vengeance

> He stood in a cross road  
> And stared far down both the forks  
> And as far as he could see  
> They were both covered in fog  
> He could see shapes - humans and not  
> By the dark lamps on the side of the road  
> Some wriggling like earthworms  
> And the rest still as a corpse.


> He cupped his hand and did he bark  
> Hollered at them, standing by the mark  
> No one spoke back and they were both still obscure  
> Cloaked by a fog -   
> The similar of which he had never seen before  
> They were mighty and misty  
> And they would both weigh you down  
> But they did differ in their colors  
> For one was red and the other dark.

> He looked closer at the sign  
> Ont the cross road fork  
> Squinted his eyes to look through the fork  
> Which was still lighter than  
> What lay ahead in the road  
> And yet he couldn't see what it said  
> For his eyes were clouded with the smoke of dismay.  

> He chose the red  
> He walked down the road  
> And soon he saw little boys  
> Slitting each other's throats  
> It thundered of anger  
> And rained of blood  
> And once in a while  
> He saw a lonely man  
> Slumped by the dark lamp posts  

> He approached the nearest one  
> And did he ask  
> "Where am I and was what was in the fork?"  
> The man replied, "On vengeance, are you."  
> The other was "grief".  
> "I have killed everyone I knew", continued he.
> "And it calmed me down, for a few happy days.
> And now I lie here, waiting to die."

> "Why don't you go back ?", asked I.  
> "The choice is eternal ", said he  
> "And I bet you didn't see   
> The third option on the crossroad  
> It was hope and it was the best of them all".  

# Invisible Boy
> I know who you are  
> And I have known you for a long time.  
> You are the little boy,  
> who stayed across the street  
> And loved to sip on coconut water  
> Always afraid it would finish.  
> I have seen you studying late night  
> Afraid of failing,  
> But never appearing for an exam  
> Being stuck in a hospital bed  
> You cried, "I lost."  
> And "To what ?", when I asked,  
> You said, "Fever".  
> I said "Heart."  


> I used to know who you were  
> But I haven't seen you for long.  
> The last I heard, I heard your wails  
> Crying out loud, from the district morgue.  
> I heard you lost your girl  
> One before birth and one while you were away  
> Fighting for what you wanted to be.  
> They said you returned a lost person  
> Didn't believe I then,  
> But now I see.  
> And I believe you sleep  
> Crying in your bed  
> By the old garbage road  
> You cry, "I lost."  
> And  "To What ?", when I ask,  
> You say, "Fate."  
> I say "Hope."  

> I think I know what you will do -  
> Get high by the old junkyard  
> And sleep on the rotten quilt.  
> Too broken to dream of hope  
> Too tired to slit your throat.  
> And stay will you there  
> For a decade or so, wishing every day  
> That you died yesterday.  
> And afraid of questions you will have to answer  
> On the other side of the door,  
> You will wish to go to a place far away  
> From both heaven and hell  
> And every night in your sleep,  
> You will cry like a broken radio.  
> Squeaking and squealing you will say in your head,  
> "Take me away, I have lost , O! you God!"  
> And a growl will say, "It is the devil."  
> "And nowhere will you go"  
> "Repent will you, for the sins you have done."  
> " You have broken hearts and hope!"  
> "Whose heart ?" , You will ask , "And Whose hope ?"  
> "Yours, my child," will he say, "Spread thee sadness"  
> The devil will say, 'People like you are my golden children.'
