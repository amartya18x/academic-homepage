Dear Tonks,

Were a wonderful time- the time we were—
But the battle was great and sacrifices were made.
Brave you were, bot now and ten,
Struggled trough turmoils of gargantuan scale.
Like the tiny piece of coal
Tat burns in the darkest winter
You will be remembered for seven stages and more
Whichever lasts longer.

On a score years and days a few,
Since you’re born
Writ tis I t wish you goodness
And more for years t come.
Immortal thou art in “Te Elysian Fields”
I task an “angel” t send you tis.
And behold ty surprise,
For she were born the same day thou wert.

Hear I thy whisper like a void in the clouds,
Sweet as ever, melting the cotton
In an effortless endeavour.
In the name of Merlin, I fought the battle hard
But little soldiers as we were, we al played our part.
I hear Harry lived and the dark lord collapsed.
The angel tells me its a beautiful world out there.

If you ever get tis letter, know it’s Lupin
Sometimes I get invisible,
But always (by) ty side I persist.
And tis I say to the angel I tasked,
“Deliver tis letter to Tonks and only her
And if not, read it for yourself
For thou art her!”

--Remus Lee Lupin
