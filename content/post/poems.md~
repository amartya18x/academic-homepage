>He had always been there.  
>In the dark and wet soil waited he,  
>For going out to the lighter place.  
>He did hear about it from his crawling friend.  
>But he couldn't move and so he waited  
>Once in a while drenched when it rained  
>And sometimes dried to a pulp  
>But he survived though all this,  
>For his mother piped down whatever he needed.

>One fine day, there was a tug  
>And a pull and a crack in the sky.  
>And he was pulled out in the open.  
>His roots were severed and washed  
>And he was tossed onto a truck,  
>Ready for a journey of the world.  

> He had never been happier.  

>Soon though, his life took many turns.  
>When entered he a kitchen-  
>his skin filled with holes  and burns.  
>Tossed into hot boiling water,  
>much hotter than those famines,  
>Cut into pieces and smashed,  
>he was stuffed into a dead chicken  
>And all he longed was to get back his damp dark soil.

>I was so happy, blessed by my generosity  
>For I am an home to the wretched,  
>a bed for those miserably and painfully  
>__thrown__ into the material oblivion.  
>And I was so proud too  
>For he cleaned me everyday  
>And to mourn the __passing away__ of those wretched,  
>He would cover me in the lightest black fabric.  
>I would never understand though
>why they so much would hate me.  
>I would learn later they called me their nemesis.

>But often I wondered, what would happen of me  
>If I ever grew wretched.  
>Would someone mourn for me too?  
>And would they pass me off too with other old people?  
>Karma would take care of me. I knew karma would.
>After all I did abound in karmic goods.
>And hence worried I not.

>One fine morning, picked I was.  
>They broke my sides.  
>Crushed my mouth  
>They told me, I had to be recycled.  
>Off I went, after all the good works  
>Into the mouth of the hell, into the fiery gates  
>And sooner than not bit by bit, my body gave away.  
>A bit into a pen factory  
>A bit into those thin black fabric  
>And the rest to make some more __Nemesis__
